# ACIT 2420 Assignment 2 

The purpose of this project is to develop a series of scripts which enable easy installation of essential software packages and configuration of the system using symbolic links stored in a remote Git repository. 

It also allows a new user on a Linux system with customizable options. The script allows you to specify the user's shell, home directory, group memberships, and password. It also ensures the userâ€™s home directory is set up properly.

## Project 1: System Setup Automation Script

### Description:
This project includes a set of scripts that automate the process of configuring a new system. It handles:
- Installing required packages.
- Creating symbolic links for configuration files 
- Ensuring that the appropriate directories are created and linked.

The scripts provided automate these tasks to set up a user-friendly environment on a new system.

### Scripts:
1. **config script**: Controls the execution of other setup scripts.
   - It can run the package installer, create symbolic links, or do both.
   
2. **config symlink**: Creates symbolic links for configuration files and directories such as `bashrc`, `tmux.conf`, and `kakrc` to appropriate locations in the user's home directory.

3. **package installer**: Installs the list of packages defined in a `packages.txt` file.

### Usage:

- To run the setup and symlink creation:
  ```bash
  ./config_script -x

  
## Project 2: User Creation Script

## Description

This script automates the process of creating new users on a Linux system. It allows the user to:
- Create a user with a specified username, shell, and home directory.
- Set a unique UID and GID for the user (with default values if not specified).
- Add the user to a primary group that matches their username.
- Add the user to additional groups as specified.
- Copy the contents of `/etc/skel` into the new user's home directory for a default setup.
- Set the user's password using the `passwd` utility.

## Features:
- Create a user with a specific shell.
- Create a home directory for the user and set proper permissions.
- Assign the user to a primary group based on the username.
- Add the user to additional groups if needed.
- Set the password for the new user.

## Usage

The script accepts the following options:

```bash
./user_creation_script.sh -u <uid> -g <gid> -h <home_directory> -s <shell> -G <group1> <group2> <username>
```
